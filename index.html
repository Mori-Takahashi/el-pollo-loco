        Pepe, the adventurous Mexican, had lost his way in the hot desert. The sun was burning so strongly that he was slowly losing his mind. Suddenly he heard a mysterious voice: "Pepe, you have to save the world!" A shimmering door appeared in front of him and before he knew it, he was pulled inside. He found himself in a strange, two-dimensional world - chickens were jumping around everywhere. "What the hell?" he thought, confused. But the voice sounded again: "Jump on the chickens, Pepe!" He didn't hesitate for long and jumped. With a loud splash, the chickens flattened as if they were made of rubber. The further he got, the more chickens jumped towards him. Some were quick, others were slower, but Pepe flattened them all. His path led him to a large pond, where an ominous clucking sounded from the chicken coop. Pepe sensed that the final challenge was approaching - but he didn't yet know what to expect...
